if you know, you know.

**TODO:** For binl and bursts. I believe there needs to be alot more study of how there 
files should be translated into python object. Order matters, sequencer program and labels, etc. 


## Pin-configuration: 

* `pco.pins`, `pco.pins.length()`
* `pco.supplies`, `pco.supplies.length()`
* `pco.ports`, `pco.groups.length()`
* `pco.groups`, `pco.ports.length()`

## Patterns: 

#### Binl
* `binl.dmas`, `binl.dmas.area(<area>)`
